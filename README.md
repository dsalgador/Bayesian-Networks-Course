# Bayesian-Networks-Course

Bayesian networks, in the opinion of many researchers one of the most significant contribution in AI in this century, 
are graphical structures for representing the probabilistic relationships among a large number of variables and for doing 
probabilistic inference with those variables, with a huge number of application fields. One of the objectives of this course 
is to introduce them and develop in students some skill in their use in modelling, both from a theoretical and applied point of view, 
with particular emphasis on the use of appropriate software.
